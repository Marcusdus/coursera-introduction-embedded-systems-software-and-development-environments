# coursera-introduction-embedded-systems-software-and-development-environments
Contains my courseware for the [Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments by University of Colorado Boulder taught on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems/home/welcome)

This class has taught me a fair bit and definitely made me brush off my embedded knowledge from school


## Week 1
Learn basics, write a C program to do statistical analysis, and compile code

## Week 2
Learn Makefiles and the build process.  Assignment was much harder for me as I am not fluent in Makefiles.  I had to find an online resource

## Week 3
Memory and memory locations.  Learn where and why different variables are stored where they are.  The assignment was **very** hard for me and I had to take it 7 times.  Due to that, I found the solutions online, and posted them along with my explinations in the C1M3 subfolder readme.

## Final Assesment
TBD
